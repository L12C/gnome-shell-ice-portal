# GNOME Shell DB ICE Portal extension

This extension brings you the data from the ICE portal directly to your status bar.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mauricemeyer/gnome-shell-ice-portal.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/db-ice-portal@mor.re
```

Then restart your GNOME with `Alt + F2`, in the opening menu type `r` and press enter.

After that, open the GNOME Tweaks tool and under extensions, enable the extension.

## TODO

Display of the following will be integrated during one of my next train rides:

* train destination
* next stop with arrival time and delay
* arrival track
* (WifionICE connectivity)
* (delay reasons)
